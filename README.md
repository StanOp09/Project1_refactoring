# Refactoring html code for easy accessibility

## Description
The bedrock of a great website is a well descriptive html and css codes to help users understand or improve on them. As a web developer, I am committed to ensuring that my codes are clear and readable. In this project the starter code running Horiseon Solutions Services is to be refactored solely to make them accessible while maintaining the web outlook. This project has taught me about the importance of html semantics and how they impact the outlook of a website as well as making them readable to other users. 

## Method
A github repository was created for the project and cloned to my remote workspace. With the Live Server, the html was opened to ensure that changes made will not affect the overall outlook of the website. Each line was carefully checked to ensure the correct html semantic was used. To make the code much cleaner, comments were added to the top of sections where changes were made in the html and css files. Changes made were added and committed to the main repository. Finally changes were pushed to github. A README.md file to describe the project was added to the repository.
