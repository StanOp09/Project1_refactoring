# Refactoring html code for easy accessibility

## Description
The bedrock of a great website is a well descriptive html and css codes to help users understand or improve on them. As a web developer, I am committed to ensuring that my codes are clear and readable. In this project the backend code running Horiseon Solutions Services is to be refactored solely to make them accessible while maintaining the web outlook. This project has taught me about the importance of html semantics and how they impact the outlook of a website as well as making them readable to other users.
